  <p> Phipps Neighborhoods Career Network: Healthcare (CNH) is a program in partnership with Phipps Houses, Hostos Community College and Montefiore that offers career development opportunities to youth in the Bronx.
</p>

  <p> Youth between the ages of 18 and 24 who are out of work and out of school can secure healthcare-related training, employment or education credentials based on their interest. According to the Phipps <a href="https://www.phippsny.org/programs/career-readiness/career-network/">website</a>, these jobs include, ”nursing (home health aides, certified nursing assistants, licensed practical nurse, patient care technician), allied health (restorative aide, physical therapy aide, surgical technician, clinical lab technician), and other healthcare related roles (sterile process, patient transport, environment and dietary support services, medical secretary).” </p>

  <p>Daniel Agosto, the workforce Development Program Director at Phipps, explained that the program is meant to be flexible to ensure students find a career path they enjoy. <!p>
  <p> “There's going to be various entry points for anyone that does complete the program, depending on what they do,” he said.</p>

  <p> “There is an exploration piece that's embedded as part of this program. Most of that exploration, while it does come from Montefiore, if you're in terms of job and career exploration, also comes from Hostos in terms of them offering the information and opportunity to be able to get the healthcare certifications that are there.”</p>
  <p> The program offers students an opportunity to explore career opportunities in the healthcare system through Montefiore or other healthcare partners. Additionally, students have the opportunity to receive certifications at Hostos to continue studying in their chosen career paths.</p>

  <p> The Bronx is facing a disparity in education attainment and economic recovery. It has the lowest <a href="https://www.towncharts.com/New-York/Education/Bronx-borough-NY-Education-data.html">college degree attainment</a> rates of any borough and has a significantly higher unnemployment rate than any other borough for the past seven months. </p>

  </script>

  <p> The Bronx has also been <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109817/coronavirus-cases-rates-by-borough-new-york-city/">ranked</a> to be among the least healthy counties in New York. The COVID-19 pandemic only widened these disparities with a <a href="https://www.towncharts.com/New-York/Education/Bronx-borough-NY-Education-data.html">rate</a> of 13,635 confirmed cases per 100,000 people, second only to Staten Island, and the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page#boro">highest hospitalization rate</a> of any borough. The Bronx also has the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page#borough">lowest vaccination rate</a> of any other borough with only 50% of residents fully vaccinated. </p>
  <p> These disproportionate challenges brought attention to the need for healthcare professionals in the borough. Phipps CNH has been around since 2014, but they have been able to adapt as a response to the hardships of the pandemic. This past year, <a href="https://www.phippsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PhippsNeighborhoods_AnnualReport2020.pdf">16 young professionals</a> were able to complete their new virtual curriculum with Montefiore. </p>
  <p> Roughly 75 to 80 percent of students finish the program and are provided wages while participating in the program accordingn to Agosto. Overall, the program has led to almost 200 hires at Montefiore and other healthcare partners. The partnership serves as a pathway for advancement for low-income students in the Bronx. </p>
